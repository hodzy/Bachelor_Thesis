question      -> 	what movie is produced by warner brothers
target_entity -> 	Q126399	
entity_from_NER -> 	label from step 2

1- search target_id and get label from wikidata api
2- response from the wikidata api - id,label,description    -> from that we need the "label" 
	-> this is the entity_from_NER  
3- take the "label" and pass it to wikidata api and it will do a string search on the database and this will return us various candidates for our search string (ex. warner brothers)
4- let's say we get 4 candidates for "warner brothers" lets say they (c1, c2, c3, c4)
5- each of the candidates will have the information -id,label,description-
